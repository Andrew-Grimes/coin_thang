Mosaic Project Overview
Project Name: Mosaic
Description: Mosaic is a user-friendly, UI-based AI agent platform that leverages context learning and integrates with a cryptocurrency payment or token system.
Goal: Enable non-technical or semi-technical users to easily create, configure, and deploy custom AI “agents” or workflows, powered by large language models (LLMs) and advanced memory capabilities, all while handling seamless crypto-based payment gating or transactions.

1. Key Features
No-Code / Low-Code Agent Builder

A web-based interface (e.g., React or Vue) that lets users configure AI agents without needing to write code.
Drag-and-drop or form-based workflow design: prompts, memory settings, external API “tools,” etc.
Context Learning & Memory

Short-Term Memory: Rolling conversation buffers, capturing recent user messages.
Long-Term Memory: Vector store integration (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.) for embedding and retrieving relevant historical data, documents, or conversation history.
Cryptocurrency Integration

Users can pay or stake tokens for AI usage.
Optional on-chain verification, transaction logging, or off-chain credit tracking to minimize fees.
Supports gating advanced features or usage behind an on-chain or off-chain token balance.
LangChain Orchestration

Mosaic uses LangChain to manage prompt pipelines, conversation memory, tool usage, and agent logic.
Allows flexible “agent” customization: specifying how prompts, memory, and external “tools” are chained together.
Multi-Step Workflows & Tools

Users can integrate external APIs, databases, or custom code as “tools” the AI agent can call.
Agents can chain multiple steps to accomplish complex tasks (e.g., retrieving data, transforming it, then generating a final result).
2. High-Level Architecture
Frontend (UI)

Built with a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, etc.).
Renders a drag-and-drop or form-based interface for agent creation and a chat interface for user interactions.
Backend (Python + LangChain)

Manages user sessions, memory, and the orchestration of AI agents.
Integrates with LLMs (OpenAI API or self-hosted models), vector stores (Pinecone, FAISS, etc.), and other external services.
Crypto Microservice / Module

Handles user wallet connections, token balances, and payment logic.
May interface with a smart contract on-chain or maintain an off-chain ledger for transactions.
Databases

Relational/NoSQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user data, agent configurations, usage logs.
Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, Milvus) for long-term conversation context and document embeddings.
3. Use Cases
Conversational Chatbot with Memory

Users create a chatbot that remembers past sessions, personal details, or domain-specific knowledge.
Crypto integration to charge micro-fees per query or advanced features.
Knowledge Base Q&A

Embed company documents or FAQs into a vector store; an AI agent answers user questions with references.
Monetize or restrict advanced analytics to token holders.
Multi-Tool Agent

Agent can call APIs, access a database, or perform calculations before returning an answer.
Transaction gating: each “tool call” might cost a fraction of a token.
4. Future Directions
Enhanced UI Builder: Expand on the drag-and-drop paradigm with robust “blocks” for memory, prompt templates, and crypto settings.
Advanced Payment Models: Offer subscription plans, pay-per-transaction, or staking-based access.
On-Chain / Off-Chain Hybrid: Balance transparency and security with affordability and speed.
Plugin Ecosystem: Encourage third-party developers to build and share new tools or agent templates.
5. Contributing

Issues & Feature Requests


Notes for Future Collaborators (Human or AI)
Context Memory: Mosaic is heavily reliant on context-based learning. Check the vector store integration and LangChain memory modules for any changes before adding new features.
Crypto Integration: If you’re extending payment logic, ensure that transaction checks, balances, and on-chain/off-chain flows are consistent with the existing codebase.
New Agents or Tools: Consider how to present them in the UI so users can intuitively add them to their workflows
